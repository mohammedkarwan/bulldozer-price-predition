🚜 Bulldozer Price Prediction using Linear Regression
___
A machine learning regression project that predicts the actual sale price of bulldozers using historical auction data. This project utilizes a Linear Regression model to estimate bulldozer prices based on several machine attributes.
___
📌 Objective
---
The goal of this project is to predict the real-world auction price of bulldozers based on features such as manufacturing year, usage, and product size. Accurate price prediction helps in better valuation and decision-making during auctions or resale.
___
## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for model building and evaluation

___
📊 Dataset
---
The dataset bulldozer_data.csv contains historical information on bulldozer auctions, including:

**YearMade – Manufacturing year**
**MachineHoursCurrentMeter – Total usage hours**
**UsageBand – Usage category (Low, Medium, High)**
**ProductSize – Size classification of the bulldozer**
SalePrice – The actual target price to predict
___
🧪 Project Workflow
---
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   Load CSV file and handle missing values

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Convert categorical features using one-hot encoding

3. **Train-Test Split**  
   Use 80% for training and 20% for testing

4. **Model Building**  
   Train a LinearRegression model

5. **Evaluation**  
   Calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a performance metric
   ___
   ✅ Results
--
The model predicts continuous sale prices for bulldozers based on historical data. The mean squared error (MSE) is
printed as a basic performance indicator.
